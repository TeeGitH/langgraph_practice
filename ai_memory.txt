=== LangGraph Agent System Development Log ===

Project Overview:
- A hierarchical multi-agent system using LangGraph
- Consists of: Chief, Assistant1, Assistant2, and Summarizer agents
- Visualization available in agent_flow.png

System Architecture:
1. Chief Agent (Top Level)
   - Receives tasks and delegates to assistants
   - Coordinates overall execution

2. Assistant Agents (Middle Level)
   - Assistant 1: Handles Personnel, Logistics, and PR
   - Assistant 2: Handles Intelligence and Operation Planning
   - Work in parallel after receiving tasks from Chief

3. Summarizer Agent (Final Level)
   - Integrates plans from both assistants
   - Creates comprehensive execution summary

Available Tasks:
A. Organize a major corporate event for 500 people
B. Develop and execute a company-wide digital transformation strategy
C. Plan and implement a global market expansion into three new countries
D. Design and launch a comprehensive employee wellness and development program
E. Create a crisis management and business continuity plan for multiple scenarios

Key Files:
1. main.py - Main program with task selection and workflow execution
2. nodes.py - Agent definitions and behaviors
3. agent_state.py - State management for the agent system
4. graph_setup.py - Graph configuration for agent interactions
5. agent_flow.png - Visual representation of agent workflow
6. .env - Configuration for OpenAI API key
7. .env.example - Template for environment setup
8. ai_memory.txt - Development log and system documentation

Development Progress:
1. Initial setup with basic agent structure
2. Added visualization using Graphviz
3. Implemented parallel processing for assistants
4. Added task selection menu with 5 predefined tasks
5. Improved error handling and user interface
6. Added documentation and setup instructions

Technical Details:
- Using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model
- LangGraph for agent workflow management
- Graphviz for workflow visualization
- Python-dotenv for environment management

Future Considerations:
1. Potential for adding more specialized agents
2. Enhanced error handling and recovery
3. Persistent storage for task results
4. More interactive user interface
5. Additional task types and configurations

Dependencies:
- langchain
- langgraph
- graphviz
- IPython
- langchain-openai
- python-dotenv

Change Log:
- Initial creation of ai_memory.txt
- Added Change Log section
